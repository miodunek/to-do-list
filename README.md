# To-do list App
Simple To-Do List program for Summer Of Code week 3 exercise: https://www.flynerd.pl/2023/07/zadanie-python-funkcje-moduly.html

## Features
* Add a Task: You can add a new task to your list. Each task is timestamped with the date and time it was added.
  
* Show Tasks: You can display all the tasks in your to-do list along with their index, description, timestamp, and completion status.
  
* Mark as Completed: You can mark a task as completed when you've finished it.
  
* Save and Load: Tasks are saved to a file called to-do-list.txt and loaded when you run the program again, so you don't lose your tasks between sessions.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

1. Download the main.py and to-do-list.txt files to your computer.

2. Open a terminal

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the files

4. Run the program by executing the following command:
```
python to-do-list.py
```

## How to use
* When you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu of options:
```
1. Add a task
2. Show tasks
3. Mark as completed
4. Quit
```
* Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.

## Note
* Tasks are displayed with an index number that you can use to mark them as completed.

* When a task is marked as completed, its status changes from "Not completed" to "Completed."

* If you delete the to-do-list.txt file, your tasks will be lost, so be cautious!
